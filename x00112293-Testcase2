Students can sometimes run into difficulties during the first year. We believe that by giving you that bit of extra help and support during the first year we can set you on your way. It is very important that you experience success with study and assignments at an early stage. It is in nobody’s interest that you feel down or oppressed about the burden of study. What is studied in first year is continued throughout your programme. Once you get the hang of things and know the study scene you won’t mind asking for help.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Site Links HomeFull Time CoursesPart Time CoursesResearch &amp; InnovationStudent LifeAbout UsContact Us <br /> Shortcuts NewsLocationStaff SearchStaff/Student LoginEduroamSearch Site <br /> Other Links DisclaimerFOISitemapCookie PolicyData ProtectionOffice of the OmbudsmanOrganisational StructureStudent Data Collection Notice <br /> Contact Us ITT Dublin Institute of Technology Tallaght,<br /> Tallaght,<br /> Dublin 24, Ireland.<br /> Tel: +353 1 404 2000<br /> Fax: +353 1 404 2700<br /> Email: info@ittdublin.ie<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ©2014 ITT Dublin: Institute of Technology Tallaght • Built by Digital Crew</td>
